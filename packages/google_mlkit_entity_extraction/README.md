A Flutter plugin to use [Google's ML Kit Entity Extractor API](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/language/entity-extraction) to recognize specific entities within static text.

## Getting Started

Before you get started read about the requirements and known issues of this plugin [here](https://github.com/bharat-biradar/Google-Ml-Kit-plugin#requirements).

### Supported languages

Entity extraction supports the following languages:

- Arabic
- Portuguese
- English (US, UK)
- Dutch
- French
- German
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Polish
- Russian
- Chinese (Simplified, Traditional)
- Spanish
- Thai
- Turkish

## Usage

### Entity Extraction

#### Create an instance of `EntityExtractor`

```dart
final entityExtractor = EntityExtractor(language: EntityExtractorOptions.english);
```

#### Process text

```dart
final List<EntityAnnotation> annotations = await entityExtractor.annotateText(text);

for (final annotation in annotations) {
  annotation.start
  annotation.end
  annotation.text
  for (final entity in annotation.entities) {
    entity.type
    entity.rawValue
  }
}
```

Make sure you download the language model before annotating any text.

#### Release resources with `close()`

```dart
entityExtractor.close();
```

### Managing remote models

#### Create an instance of model manager

```dart
final modelManager = EntityExtractorModelManager();
```

#### Check if model is downloaded

```dart
final bool response = await modelManager.isModelDownloaded(model);
```

#### Download model

```dart
final bool response = await modelManager.downloadModel(model);
```

#### Delete model

```dart
final bool response = await modelManager.deleteModel(model);
```

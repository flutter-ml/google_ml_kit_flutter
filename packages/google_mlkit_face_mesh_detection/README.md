A Flutter plugin to use [Google's ML Kit Face Mesh Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-mesh-detection) for face mesh detection, you can generate in real-time a high accuracy [face mesh](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-mesh-detection/concepts) of 468 3D points for selfie-like images.

Faces should be within ~2 meters (~7 feet) of the camera, so that the faces are sufficiently large for optimal face mesh recognition. In general, the larger the face, the better the face mesh recognition.

If you want to detect faces further than ~2 meters (~7 feet) away from the camera, please see [google_mlkit_face_detection](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_face_detection).

Note that the face should be facing the camera with at least half of the face visible. Any large object between the face and the camera may result in lower accuracy.

**NOTE** Since [Google's Face Mesh Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-mesh-detection) API is still in Beta and only supports Android. Stay tune for updates in their website.

**PLEASE READ THIS** before continuing or posting a [new issue](https://github.com/flutter-ml/google_ml_kit_flutter/issues):

- [Google's ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) was build only for mobile platforms: iOS and Android apps.

- This plugin is not sponsor or maintained by Google. The [authors](https://github.com/flutter-ml/google_ml_kit_flutter/blob/master/AUTHORS) are developers excited about machine learning that wanted to expose Google's native APIs to Flutter.

- Google's ML Kit APIs are ony developed natively for iOS and Android. This plugin uses Flutter Platform Channels as explained [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/platform-channels).

  Messages are passed between the client (the app/plugin) and host (platform) using platform channels as illustrated in this diagram:

  <p align="center" width="100%">
    <img src="https://docs.flutter.dev/assets/images/docs/PlatformChannels.png"> 
  </p>

  Messages and responses are passed asynchronously, to ensure the user interface remains responsive. To read more about platform channels go [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/platform-channels).

  Because this plugin uses platform channels, no Machine Learning processing is done in Flutter/Dart, all the calls are passed to the native platform using `MethodChannel` in Android and `FlutterMethodChannel` in iOS, and executed using the Google's native APIs. Think of this plugin as a bridge between your app and Google's native ML Kit APIs. This plugin only passes the call to the native API and the processing is done by Google's API. It is important that you understand this concept when it comes to debugging errors for your ML model and/or app.

- Since the plugin uses platform channels, you may encounter issues with the native API. Before submitting a new issue, identify the source of the issue. You can run both iOS and/or Android native [example apps by Google](https://github.com/googlesamples/mlkit) and make sure that the issue is not reproducible with their native examples. If you can reproduce the issue in their apps then report the issue to Google. The [authors](https://github.com/flutter-ml/google_ml_kit_flutter/blob/master/AUTHORS) do not have access to the source code of their native APIs, so you need to report the issue to them. If you find that their example apps are okay and still you have an issue using this plugin, then look at our [closed and open issues](https://github.com/flutter-ml/google_ml_kit_flutter/issues). If you cannot find anything that can help you then report the issue and provide enough details. Be patient, someone from the community will eventually help you.

## Requirements

### iOS

- Minimum iOS Deployment Target: 12.0
- Xcode 13.2.1 or newer
- Swift 5
- ML Kit does not support 32-bit architectures (i386 and armv7). ML Kit does support 64-bit architectures (x86_64 and arm64). Check this [list](https://developer.apple.com/support/required-device-capabilities/) to see if your device has the required device capabilities. More info [here](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/migration/ios).

Since ML Kit does not support 32-bit architectures (i386 and armv7), you need to exclude armv7 architectures in Xcode in order to run `flutter build ios` or `flutter build ipa`. More info [here](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/migration/ios).

Go to Project > Runner > Building Settings > Excluded Architectures > Any SDK > armv7

<p align="center" width="100%">
  <img src="https://github.com/flutter-ml/google_ml_kit_flutter/blob/master/resources/build_settings_01.png">
</p>

Your Podfile should look like this:

```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0'  # or newer version

...

# add this line:
$iOSVersion = '12.0'  # or newer version

post_install do |installer|
  # add these lines:
  installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
    config.build_settings["EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=*]"] = "armv7"
    config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = $iOSVersion
  end
  
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
    
    # add these lines:
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      if Gem::Version.new($iOSVersion) > Gem::Version.new(config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'])
        config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = $iOSVersion
      end
    end
    
  end
end
```

Notice that the minimum `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is 12.0, you can set it to something newer but not older.

### Android

- minSdkVersion: 21
- targetSdkVersion: 33
- compileSdkVersion: 33

## Usage

### Face Mesh Detection

#### Create an instance of `InputImage`

Create an instance of `InputImage` as explained [here](https://github.com/flutter-ml/google_ml_kit_flutter/blob/master/packages/google_mlkit_commons#creating-an-inputimage).

```dart
final InputImage inputImage;
```

#### Create an instance of `FaceMeshDetector`

```dart
final meshDetector = FaceMeshDetector(option: FaceMeshDetectorOptions.faceMesh);
```

#### Process image

```dart
final List<FaceMesh> meshes = await meshDetector.processImage(inputImage);

for (FaceMesh mesh in meshes) {
  final boundingBox = mesh.boundingBox;
  final points = mesh.points;
  final triangles = mesh.triangles;
  final contour = mesh.contours[FaceMeshContourType.faceOval];
}
```

#### Release resources with `close()`

```dart
meshDetector.close();
```

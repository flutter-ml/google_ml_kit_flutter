A Flutter plugin to use [Google's ML Kit Pose Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/pose-detection) to detect the pose of a subject's body in real time from a continuous video or static image.

## Getting Started

Before you get started read about the requirements and known issues of this plugin [here](https://github.com/bharat-biradar/Google-Ml-Kit-plugin#requirements).

## Usage

### Pose Detection

#### Create an instance of `InputImage`

Create an instance of `InputImage` as explained [here](https://github.com/bharat-biradar/Google-Ml-Kit-plugin/tree/master/packages/google_mlkit_commons#creating-an-inputimage).

```dart
final InputImage inputImage;
```

#### Create an instance of `PoseDetector`

```dart
final options = PoseDetectorOptions();
final poseDetector = PoseDetector(options: options);
```

#### Process image

```dart
final List<Pose> poses = await poseDetector.processImage(inputImage);

for (Pose pose in poses) {
  // to access all landmarks
  pose.landmarks.forEach((_, landmark) {
    final type = landmark.type;
    final x = landmark.x;
    final y = landmark.y;
  }
  
  // to access specific landmarks
  final landmark = pose.landmarks[PoseLandmarkType.nose];
}
```

#### Release resources with `close()`

```dart
poseDetector.close();
```

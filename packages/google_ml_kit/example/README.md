# google\_ml\_kit example app

Demonstrates how to use the google_ml_kit plugin.

This example app is not production code, its purpose is to demonstrate some of the functionality of all the plugins under [google\_ml\_kit](https://github.com/bharat-biradar/Google-Ml-Kit-plugin/tree/master/packages/google_ml_kit). If you find any issue with it fell free to contribute. Pull request are always welcome.

## Getting Started

Since the example app includes demo code for all the ML Kit APIs, some of them allow [Custom Models](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/custom-models). If you need more details go [here](https://github.com/bharat-biradar/Google-Ml-Kit-plugin/tree/master#firebase-dependency-custom-models).

For that reason, in order to run the example app you will need to add a `GoogleService-Info.plist` to your local copy of the iOS project, and a `google-services.json` to your local copy of the Android project. For more details how to do that go to:

- [Add Firebase to your Android project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)
- [Add Firebase to your iOS project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
